# ElectronForce

ElectronForce is a simple cross platform graphic interface for the Salesforce APIs using the [JSForce](https://jsforce.github.io/) library.

## Larger Vision

Create a tool that not only can explore and interact with the Salesforce APIs, but also documents, tracks, and reports on elements of a build that are critical for integrations with 3rd party solutions. And while we're at it, Data Loader needs a replacement.

It will need to:
1. Connect to one or more orgs.
2. Export object field metadata and at the field level:
    * Support markup of field used in integrations.
    * Allow definitions of sample data for each field.
    * Save annotations for later use.
3. Flag relavent differences between orgs.
4. Generate sample data for both Salesforce import and CSV export.
5. Generate human readable specs and documentation for the relavent objects and fields.

This project has no direct association with Salesforce except the use of the APIs provided under the terms of use of their services.
